# student-dashboard-product-plan

Overview

This project presents a complete Product Plan and Wireframe for a Student Communication Dashboard built for Accredian.
The goal is to eliminate students’ dependency on external apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, and LinkedIn by creating a focused, distraction-free communication space inside Accredian’s platform.

This repository demonstrates strong skills in product thinking, user empathy, feature design, wireframing, and documentation.

 Background

Students currently rely on external communication platforms which lead to:

Missed updates

Scattered conversations

Lack of focus

Privacy concerns

Difficulty collaborating on assignments

A built-in dashboard simplifies interactions and keeps all learning-related communication in one place.

 Problem Statements

“I am a student trying to collaborate with classmates, but using different external apps confuses me and slows my learning, which makes me feel frustrated.”

“I want to ask questions quickly, but switching between apps breaks my focus, which makes me feel overwhelmed.”

 Goals

Create a simple and focused chat environment

Keep batch discussions organized

Allow students to ask doubts instantly

Reduce dependency on WhatsApp/Telegram

Increase in-platform engagement and collaboration

 Hypothesis

If Accredian provides an easy-to-use communication dashboard built for learning, students will prefer it over external apps and use it for study-related conversations.

 Key Features

One-on-One Chat: Private conversations between students

Batch & Study Groups: Auto-created groups for classes and projects

Mentor Announcements: Important updates from mentors

File Sharing: Share notes, links, and documents

Polls: Quick feedback collection

AI Query Assistant: Instant answers to student questions

Mock Tests: Practice tests based on lessons

Help Desk: Report app issues and get support within 24 hours

 Vision Narrative

Riya logs into Accredian before her class. She checks her batch group where classmates are discussing an assignment. She joins the chat, gets help instantly, sees her mentor’s announcements, and accesses a mock test suggested by the AI assistant—all without switching apps.
The dashboard becomes her single source of learning and communication.
